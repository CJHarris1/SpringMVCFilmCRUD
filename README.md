# SpringMVCFilmCRUD

## Overview


##Tech Used
SpringMVC, Eclipse, SQL, mySQL workbench, Java, html

##Lessons Learned
Communication is key to avoid merge conflicts. Muscle memory in the proper processes is important. Getting used to skipping steps (like git pull) can lead to accidental merge conflict mistakes. Get used to doing it the right way every time. Linking controllers, DAO, and jsps was a huge challenge in making the app work. Seeing how the changes you make to one file affects the other files and becoming used to adjusting all related files on the fly to create a desired result was very difficult at first but became more intuitive with repetition. Using the web dev tools and learning to read error messages was paramount in completing this project. Multiple times when things looked like they should be working we traced our errors and fixed issues that we had overlooked.
